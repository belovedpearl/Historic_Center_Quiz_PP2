 ---

## Design Choices

---


* For simplicity and my hope to learn more so that users can improve the game appearance to their desired choice, I have opted to use linear gradient to design the body.



### Font

* Andika
    * I believe it is a clean font for this game and its bold, its sourcr is google font.
* Sans-serif
    * This is set as a fall-back font for device that might not load google fonts and its easily available.


### Colour Scheme

   
   In line with the motive of the website, I have selected a shade of green **(Hex Value = #184E20)** and **White** to complement the green nature attribute that the site promotes.
   Using [color contrast checker](https://dequeuniversity.com/) have checked the contrast of both colors use as foreground and background. Contrast result gave the following;

   |Foreground | Background | Contrast Ratio | Comment |
   |-----------|------------|----------------|---------|
   | #184E20   |  White     | 9.76 : 1       |  Pass   |
   | White     |  #184E20   | 9.76 : 1       |  Pass   |

   
   I have also used **RGB(230,32,65)** as an **accent** color to especially in places where the users attention is needed.
